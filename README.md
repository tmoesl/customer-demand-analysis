# Customer Demand Analysis For Online Delivery App
The Customer Demand Analysis project aims to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sample data from an online food ordering and delivery app used by New York restaurants. The primary goal is to uncover key business metrics that can improve operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive company growth.

## Motivation


### Key Metrics

1. Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)
2. Average Order Value (AOV)
3. Order Volume
4. Net Revenue
5. Profit Margin
6. Customer Retention Rate
7. Net Promoter Score (NPS)
8. Customer Rating Participation Rate
9. Delivery Time
10. Driver Utilization Rate
11. Market Penetration Rate

### Key Questions

1. What are the key factors influencing customer satisfaction and order ratings, and how can rating participation be increased?
2. How do order volumes and customer preferences vary by day of the week and cuisine type, and how can these insights be leveraged to drive growth?
3. What operational metrics can be improved to enhance delivery efficiency, especially on weekdays, and reduce order completion times?
4. Which restaurants are the top performers in terms of order volume, revenue, and customer satisfaction, and how can partnerships with them be optimized?
5. What is the behavior of high-activity users, and what strategies can be implemented to increase engagement and retention across the customer base?

### Data Analysis and Visualization

To answer these questions, the following data analysis and visualization techniques were employed:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, correcting special characters in restaurant names, and creating new features like order completion time.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing the data to understand the distribution of key metrics such as order cost, preparation time, delivery time, and ratings.
3. **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzing the distribution of individual features to identify trends and patterns.
4. **Multivariate Analysis**: Examining relationships between different features, such as cuisine type, day of the week, and customer ratings.
5. **Visualizations**: Creating count plots, histograms, boxplots, violin plots, hexbin plots, and correlation heatmaps to visually represent the data and uncover insights.
